# Groq & Usage with CreatureChat
How to set up **Groq** with **CreatureChat** to use it and play for free

## 1. Setting up Groq & Logging in
Just head on to **[Groq](https://groq.com/)** and log in with your Google account. (follow image below)

After successfully logging in, we can start creating our **API Key**, which will power the AI we are gonna use for the mod.

## 2. Creating API Key
Head on to **[GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com/keys)**, where we will create a key.
Click on the **Create API Key** button. A popup will show, name your key whatever you'd like. I will choose "CreatureChat". After that, Create your key and **copy it and save it somewhere safe, where you can copy it again**, such as a Discord DM to a bot or a friend who doesn't understand this stuff. *(follow the screenshots below)*

### Congratulations. You passed the hardest part.
Your dashboard will now look like this:![key dashboard](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204560010445852783/1250882841311445012/image.png?ex=666c8eed&is=666b3d6d&hm=0f61bb9ce6c23dedc070f4d4888cde1b2b215414c560a3d5e75fef0e48e64b61&)
I already made some keys for other purposes, but as you can see, I have this **CreatureChat** key I/we just made. It's created date should be whatever date it is right now and the *"Last Used"* stat should be "*Never*".

# 3. Minecraft Setup
To install the mod, **[follow this guide made by the creators on Youtube](https://youtu.be/P2txUop_kSM?si=6Swz90w7P3pmPSlm)** and don't ask for a tutorial by me, follow the official guide.
**The important Minecraft part in this guide will be the commands**.
## Setting up the mod
Load into any of your singleplayer worlds or multiplayer if you're trying to do that and do these following commands:
`/creaturechat model set llama3-8b-8192`
`/creaturechat url set "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions"`
Note: don't go on the site in the second command, *it's an API it shouldn't be accessed by normal means.*
### Now setting up the part that powers the mod and the final part
Enter in your Minecraft chat:
`/creaturechat key set <key you copied from before>`
Confused? The key from step 2. I hope you saved it somewhere, or just do *Control + V*.
Lost it? Just follow step 2 from the start. Same process.

### That's it! Have fun!
